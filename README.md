# DeepaMehta 4 Wikidata Toolkit

This plugin provides the functionality to transform selected entities from a wikidata JSON dump file into DeepaMehta 4 Topics and to expose custom queries over those by means of a REST API.

For a detailed and complete description of what this module does, how it works and can be customized please read [this blogpost](http://infokitchen.net/building-a-microservice-for-querying-wikidata/).

Note: This plugin makes use of the WikidataToolkit and therefore _requires_ Java 1.7 or higher.

## Requirements

DeepaMehta 4 is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.
https://github.com/jri/deepamehta

## Download & Installation

You can find a bundle file for installation at [http://download.deepamehta.de](http://download.deepamehta.de).

Copy the downloaded `dm45-wikidata-toolkit-0.2.jar` file into your DeepaMehta bundle repository and re-start your [DeepaMehta installation](https://github.com/jri/deepamehta#requirements).

## Usage

1 Download one of the json dumps from  [http://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/wikidata/](http://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/wikidata/).

2 Find (, probably edit) and use the commands provided by any topic of type "Wikidata Dump Import". It provides two commands to 
* Start importing (`Create topics`) or removing wikidata entities as configured (`Delete topics`)
* Control aspects (via `Edit` of the "to-be-imported" data-values (like language) and relations (like websites)

## REST API

To get the REST API to respond correctly you need to associate/map the _Wikidata Property_ topics your API endpoint shall understand to the desired _Association Type_. To get started you can copy [this configuration](http://wikidata-topics.beta.wmflabs.org/topicmap/1594).

You can do GET requests like the following and return a simple list of JSON topics/assocations:

- `/wdtk/list/P108/Q9531/` <br/>
   Responding with a list of _employees of_ of the _British Broadcasting Corporation_
- `/wdtk/list/P108/Q9531/with/P27/Q183/`<br/>
   Responding with a list of _employees of_ BBC which are also _citizens of_ Germany
- `/wdtk/list/claims/P108`
   Responding with a list of all claims made using the _employee of_ property (naming both players)
- `/wdtk/list/claims/P27/Q183`
   Responding with a list of all claims made using the _citizen of_ property where one player is the Country _Germany_

Here on the `geo-fronts` branch we're developing new experimental endpoints, three current are:

- `/wdtk/list/items/iso-coded`<br/>
   Responding with a list of wikidata items we know the Three Letter IS Codes for.   
- `/wdtk/list/items/osm-relations`
   Responding with a list of wikidata items we know the OSM Relation IDs for.
- `/wdtk/list/items/nuts-coded`
   Responding with a list of wikidata items we know the NUTS code for

No optimizations done yet, just operating by deepamehta4 standard means (but it maybe noteworthy that @jri already solved the super-node problem for the dm4 storage layer).
