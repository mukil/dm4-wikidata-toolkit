# DeepaMehta 4 Wikidata Toolkit

This plugin provides the functionality to transform selecetd entities from a wikidata JSON dump file into DeepaMehta 4 Topics and to expose custom queries over those via a REST API.

Note: This plugin makes use of the WikidataToolkit and therefore requires Java 1.7 or higher.

## Requirements

DeepaMehta 4 is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.
https://github.com/jri/deepamehta

## Download & Installation

You can find a bundle file for installation at [http://download.deepamehta.de](http://download.deepamehta.de).

Copy the downloaded `dm45-wikidata-toolkit-0.2.jar` file into your DeepaMehta bundle repository and re-start your [DeepaMehta installation](https://github.com/jri/deepamehta#requirements).

## Usage

Find, edit and use the commands provided by any topic of type "Wikidata Dump Import" to
* start importing or removing certain entities and/or
* control aspects of the "to-be-imported" data-values (like language) and relations (like websites)
of a complete Wikidata JSON Dump.

## REST API

To get the REST API to respond correctly you need to associate/map the _Wikidata Property_ topics your API endpoint shall understand to the desired _Association Type_.

You can do GET requests like the following and return a simple list of JSON topics/assocations:

- `/wdtk/list/P108/Q9531/` <br/>
   Responding with a list of _employees of_ of the _British Broadcasting Corporation_
- `/wdtk/list/P108/Q9531/and/P27/Q183/`<br/>
   Responding with a list of _employees of_ BBC which are also _citizens of_ Germany
- `/wdtk/list/claims/P108`
   Responding with a list of all claims made using the _employee of_ property (naming both players)
- `/wdtk/list/claims/P27/Q183`
   Responding with a list of all claims made using the _citizen of_ property where one player is the Country _Germany_

For example, see http://wikidata-topics.beta.wmflabs.org/wdtk/query/P108/Q9531

No optimizations done yet, just operating by deepamehta4 standard means (but it maybe noteworthy that @jri already solved the super-node problem for the dm4 storage layer).
